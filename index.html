                    <h1>Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</h1>
                    <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

                        <h1 class="under-video">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h1>
                        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day.
                             We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                              and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills
                               and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

                         We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore
                          problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and
                           openly encouraged.</p>

                        Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills,
                         and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance
                          to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>
